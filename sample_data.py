Vessel Maintenance AI System - Sample Data Generator

This script generates realistic sample data for testing and demonstrating
the vessel maintenance AI system. It creates various types of maintenance
records, sensor alerts, and incident reports that showcase the system's
classification and analysis capabilities.

The script sends test documents to the running API server and displays
the AI analysis results, providing a comprehensive demonstration of
the system's features.

Usage:
    python sample_data.py

Requirements:
    - The main application server must be running on localhost:8000
    - The requests library must be installed
